          <p class="main-p title large">Item distribution during guild raids.</p>

          <p>The EP:GP Loot System, where "EP" represents Effort Points and "GP" signifies Gear Points, is a
            meticulous and transparent approach to distributing loot in gaming communities.</p>
          <p>
            Effort Points (EP) reflect the commitment and dedication of a player within a group or guild. These
            points
            are awarded based on various in-game contributions such as attendance, participation in raids, or
            performance in group activities. EP serves as a measure of a player's effort and investment in the
            collective progress of the team.</p>
          <p>
            Gear Points (GP), on the other hand, represent the value or desirability of an item of equipment. Each
            piece of loot within the game is assigned a specific GP value based on its rarity, utility, and overall
            impact on a player's effectiveness. GP serves as an objective metric to assess the worth of in-game
            items.</p>
          <p>
            The EP:GP Loot System functions by allowing players to earn EP through active participation, which they
            can then spend to acquire items with higher GP values. This system ensures that loot distribution is
            fair,
            transparent, and rewards players who consistently contribute to the group's success.</p>
          <p>
            By balancing Effort Points and Gear Points, the EP:GP Loot System promotes a collaborative and equitable
            loot distribution process, fostering a sense of unity and fairness within gaming communities. It serves
            as
            an effective tool to allocate rewards based on both dedication and the value of in-game items,
            ultimately
            enhancing the overall gaming experience.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="red-text quote">In any loot system, it's essential to acknowledge that loot distribution can be
              a contentious issue. However, it's crucial not to direct blame towards your fellow teammates if you do not
              receive a specific item as desired. If you feel the need to hold someone accountable, it should be either
              Blizzard or Warmane developers, as they are responsible for establishing the loot count limitations.
              Understanding these limitations can help maintain a harmonious and fair gaming environment for
              all.</span>
