                who have violated guild rules. It
                results in a temporary suspension from guild chat, Discord, and voice channels until a higher-ranking
                officer can address the issue. Officers may demote individuals to this rank if they breach guild

                in
                all

                server phase, and meet the requirements set by their Class Officer. Veterans can have up to two Alt
                Players,
                including one Main Alt and one regular Alt Player, with no priority over regular members in the second
                25-Man Raid or PvP activities. Veterans also gain access to collaborations for teaming up with other
                top
                players in BGs, dungeons, and arenas. A minimum of two months of guild playtime is required for

                responsibilities with the guild leader. In the leader's absence, the Chief-Officer has the authority

              individuals
              attaining
              this rank will be selected by the community. The determination of our Officer Team will be achieved
              through
              elections as we become better acquainted. During this period, I will handle most aspects of guild
              management, so your understanding and trust are greatly appreciated. The faster trust is established,
              the
              sooner I can delegate responsibilities to you.</p>
