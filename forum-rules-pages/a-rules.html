            <h2 class="title">General Guild Rules</h2>
            <h4 class="title"> 1. Zero Tolerance for Trouble</h4>
            <p>
              Troublemakers, such as Drama Queens/Kings, Godly Self-Centered Ego Maniacs,
              and Constant Complainers about game-related and real-life issues, will face permanent bans. Our first
              rule
              exists by design, and these individuals are unwelcome.</p>

            <h4 class="title">2. Off-Limit Topics</h4>
            <p>
              In the interest of fostering a harmonious environment, we discourage discussions
              related to politics, religion, or any other contentious real-life subjects within both our Discord and
              guild chat.</p>

            <h4 class="title">3. Respect and Appreciation</h4>
            <p>
              Demonstrating respect for fellow guild members and acknowledging each other's
              contributions is paramount. While those above Class Master may have specific responsibilities, no one
              is
              under absolute obligation. Our primary purpose is to have fun and, if possible, forge friendships.</p>

            <h4 class="title">4. Reporting Issues and Suggestions</h4>
            <p>
              We encourage open communication and problem-solving. Rather than
              escalating disputes, report problems through designated channels. If, for instance, you observe any
              abuse
              of power, it will be investigated, even if the offender holds a high-ranking position. Suggest
              improvements via a dedicated channel, with ideas considered, voted upon, and potentially integrated
              into
              our gameplay.</p>

            <h4 class="title">5. English as the Official Language</h4>
            <p>
              To maintain coherence, please use English in guild chat and during
              guild activities, including raids and battlegrounds.</p>

            <h4 class="title">6. Upholding Reputation</h4>
            <p>
              As a guild with mature, discerning members who value future collaborations, it's
              essential to preserve a positive reputation on the server. Practice politeness and respect when
              interacting with individuals outside the guild. While perfection is not expected, minimize
              confrontations,
              and report issues rather than engaging in them.</p>

            <h4 class="title">7. Fun Is Mandatory</h4>
            <p>
              In our guild, fun is a requirement, not an option. Engage in various activities,
              including PvE, PvP, guild chat interactions, or simply relaxing in Stormwind/Ironforge. Find your
              source
              of enjoyment and embrace it.</p>

            <h4 class="title">8. Active Participation</h4>
            <p>
              Active members must actively participate in guild suggestions and elections. All
              aspects, except general rules and the loot/rank systems, are subject to change. If a live vote occurs,
              and
              a majority of active members (everyone above "Member") approves the suggestion, it becomes an official
              policy or rule at the start of the second week.</p>

            <h4 class="title">9. Guild Rules as Sacred Laws</h4>
            <p>
              In over two millennia of human history, we've learned that the realm of
              imagination is boundless, especially in the absence of consequences. Rest assured, we'll uphold the
              sanctity of our guild rules. Violators will be held accountable, with sanctions, warnings, or even
              permanent bans depending on the gravity of the situation.</p>

            <h4 class="title">10. Application Protocol</h4>
            <p>
              Every prospective member must complete an application form for guild entry.
              Further information on this requirement can be found <span><a href="b-application-form.html"
                  class="link">here</a></span>.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Additional rules regarding TUS Gladiator</h2>
            <h4 class="title"> 1. Mandatory Live Communication</h4>

            <p class="tus-gladiator-rule">
              Participation in real-time voice communication on Discord is obligatory during guild PvP activities.
              Effective coordination and communication are vital for our success.</p>

            <h4 class="title"> 2. Consecutive Loss Policy</h4>
            <p class="tus-gladiator-rule">
              Gladiators are expected to maintain a high standard of performance. If a Gladiator loses two consecutive
              battlegrounds, it results in an automatic demotion. Reflect on the reasons for the losses, adapt, and aim
              to
              return to peak performance swiftly.</p>

            <h4 class="title"> 3. Drama-Free Environment</h4>
            <p class="tus-gladiator-rule">
              In our guild, open discussion and self-improvement are encouraged. However, we maintain a zero-tolerance
              policy for drama. Any grievances or weaknesses should be discussed constructively in the dedicated Discord
              channel to foster an atmosphere of improvement and collaboration.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="inactivity-policy">
            <h2 class="title">Inactivity Policy:</h2>
            <p class="normal">In our effort to maintain an active and vibrant guild, we have implemented the following
              measures to address inactivity:</p>
            <ol class="policy-ul">
              <li class="normal title">
                <p>1. Seven or More Days Offline (Below Level 60)</p>

                <p>Players below level 60 who have been inactive for seven or more days will be subject to removal from
                  the
                  guild (gkick).</p>
              </li>
              <li class="normal title">
                <p>2. One Month of Inactivity (Without Prior Notice)</p>
                <p class="normal">Players who remain inactive for one month without providing prior notice will also be
                  subject to
                  removal from the guild (gkick).</p>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="mediam red-text">We value active participation and appreciate members who keep the guild's
                vitality alive. It's
                important to communicate any anticipated periods of inactivity to prevent unintended removal from the
                guild.</p>
